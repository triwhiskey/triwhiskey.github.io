title: About

<p>My name is Peter Wolff. I'm a front-end developer who has been working in various web related roles since 2015. Primarily focused on HTML/CSS and JavaScript with experience in many modern tools and frameworks.</p>
<p>The current team I'm a part of at LeadVenture works on website products for their OEM partners such as BRP, BMW, and Harley-Davidson. In the past I also worked for CDK Global which has lead to much of my professional career involving the automotive industry in some form.</p>
<p>If you're curious about the website domain, TriWhiskey, there is a short story behind it. During college several friends and I thought to use the NATO, rather than Greek, alphabet to name a social group. It was nothing serious, but the name stuck for me and when I moved into a web related career if felt appropriate to keep it around (as a "world wide web" developer).</p>
<p>In my free time I can most often be found enjoying a story driven, single player video game or reading a book. Alternativey, I also try to get out on the PNW's incredible hiking trails when I can, and am currently working on getting the camping gear I need to attempt some overnights.</p>
